      I really like playing soccer. Its not because its exercizing and making me fit, but because it's fun. there are some benefits to playing soccer though, not just for fun. First of all, It makes me fast. Not super fast, but fast enough I can beat almost anyone in my class at a race. Secondly, It lets me lose any weight that I want to burn off.  Lastly, I get to play with other people. I can play with my friends by playing soccer.

     My Favorite team is FC barcelona although I dont watch soccer that much. Here is some information on them. Made in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, German and English Soccer players, led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a icon of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other Soccer clubs, the supporters own and manage Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06 billion, and the world's richest soccer club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840.8 million.

     My inspiration is the famous soccer player Messi. I want to try to be as good as him in soccer, if not better. He plays on the soccer club FC Barcelona Which is my favorite team.
